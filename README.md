# SaddleBronc.pro — Website

Marketing site for the SaddleBronc.pro mobile app. Built to the same pattern as
the other Rodeo Apps sites (BullRider.pro, BreakawayRoping.pro, TeamRope.pro,
TieDown.pro): Next.js App Router, Tailwind v4, Resend for the waitlist, no
database and no auth.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — development server (http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm start` — serve the production build
- `npx eslint .` — lint

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4,
Resend. Path alias `@/*` maps to `./src/*`.

## Required assets

`public/logo.png` is referenced by the header, the hero, and the OG/Twitter
card, and is **not** in the repo yet. Drop the SaddleBronc crest in before
deploying or those three places render a broken image.

`public/cross.jpg` and `public/backgrounds/arena-1.jpg` / `arena-2.jpg` are
already here, carried over from the other Rodeo Apps sites.

## Environment

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Waitlist confirmation + team notification email |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for local development, and set the same
variable in the hosting provider's project settings for preview and production.

Without it, `POST /api/waitlist` returns 503 and the form shows an error. The
build and every other page work fine without it.

The sending domain `saddlebronc.pro` must also be verified in Resend, otherwise
every send fails and the route answers 502 rather than reporting a signup that
never actually went out. The
build and every other page work fine without it.

## Structure

## Brand

Per the build map: **antique gold on midnight**. Defined in
`src/app/globals.css` — `--brand` `#c9a227`, `--cream` `#f0ead8`, on `--ink`
`#0a0e1a`. The secondary `--brand-2` is a cold steel blue `#7fa8c9`, so the
pair reads as brass on iron.

Token names (`--brand`, `--brand-deep`, `--brand-2`, `--ink*`) are identical
across all six Rodeo Apps sites — only the values differ. That is deliberate:
the sites should diff cleanly against each other.

## Positioning

Two decisions drive the copy, and they apply across the portfolio:

**Everything-app.** This is the social platform for the bronc riding community
first. Social & Community leads the feature list because it is what people open
daily. The landing page states the bar outright: if you ride broncs, you should
not need another app.

**Amateur audience.** Users are amateur, youth and college riders, not PRCA
professionals. Copy, pricing and defaults follow that, and AI ride analysis is
framed as coaching for people who cannot afford a coach.

## What makes this site different from the timed-event ones

Saddle bronc is the first event in the portfolio where **the score is not a
time**. Two judges each award 0–25 for the rider and 0–25 for the horse. That
changes the whole data model, and the landing page carries a `.score-grid`
showing the four numbers explicitly.

It is also the first where **half the score belongs to an animal the contestant
does not own**, which is why draw analysis and the stock database are the lead
differentiator, and why stock contractors are treated as first-class users
rather than as a data source.

## Rules content, and why the mark-out is tagged

Most saddle bronc rules are consistent everywhere. **The mark-out is not**: it
is an automatic disqualification under PRCA rules and, since 2024, a scored
element folded into the judges' 25 points under IPRA rules. Same physical
event, two outcomes.

`/rules` tags that with the `.assoc-tag` pill rather than asserting a single
answer. Keep that convention when editing — it is the single most likely thing
on this site to be got wrong.

## Adding a blog post

1. Create `src/app/blog/<slug>/page.tsx` with a `metadata` export and an
   `<article className="prose-arena">` body.
2. Add the entry to `src/app/blog/posts.ts` (drives the index).
3. Add the slug to `blogSlugs` in `src/app/sitemap.ts`.
