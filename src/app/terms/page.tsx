  description: "The terms governing use of the SaddleBronc.pro app and website.",
  alternates: { canonical: "https://www.saddlebronc.pro/terms" },
};

const sections = [
  {
    h: "1. Acceptance of Terms",
    p: "By creating an account or using SaddleBronc.pro, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the service. SaddleBronc.pro is operated by Apps 1, LLC.",
  },
  {
    h: "2. Eligibility and Accounts Held by Minors",
    p: "You must be at least 13 years old to create an account. Users under 18 require guardian consent, and guardian controls apply to messaging, media sharing, and location visibility. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.",
  },
  {
    h: "3. Scores Are Not Issued By Us",
    p: "Scores are awarded by association-carded judges, not by us. We display the scores producers and judges submit, and we compute totals from them. We do not judge, re-score, or arbitrate a mark. Disputes about a score, a mark-out call, or a reride decision go to the judges and the sanctioning association under their own grievance process.",
  },
  {
    h: "4. Stock Data Is Historical, Not Predictive",
    p: "Buck patterns, buck-off rates, average horse scores, and every other figure in our stock database are derived from recorded trips. They describe what a horse has done, not what it will do. A bucking horse is an animal, not a machine, and no draw analysis is a prediction or advice about whether to compete. Contractors supply herd and ownership information themselves; we do not verify it and it does not substitute for any association filing a contractor is required to make.",
  },
  {
    h: "5. Practice Data Is Not Official",
    p: "Times, catches, and other run data you record yourself are practice data. They are hand-timed, they are not verified by any judge, timer, or sanctioning body, and they are never treated as official results. Official results, standings, and payouts originate from event producers and sanctioning bodies. Nothing in the app constitutes an official record of competition unless it is provided by the producer of that event.",
  },
  {
    h: "6. Rules Information Is a Reference, Not Authority",
    p: "The rules content in the app and on this website is a plain-language reference compiled from published association rulebooks and amendments. Saddle bronc rules differ between sanctioning bodies — most importantly the mark-out rule, which is an automatic disqualification under PRCA rules and a scored element under IPRA rules — and our reference labels those differences rather than asserting a single answer. It is not a rulebook and it is not competitive or legal advice. Where our reference and an association's current rulebook disagree, the rulebook governs. Ground rules for a specific rodeo override association rules for that rodeo.",
  },
  {
    h: "7. Events, Entries, and Payments",
    p: "Event listings, entry fees, added money, office charges, class configurations, ground rules, and sanctioning status are supplied by event producers. We are not the producer of events listed in the app and we are not responsible for the conduct, cancellation, scoring, or payout of any event. Entry fees paid through the app are collected on behalf of the producer, subject to that producer's own entry, draw-out, and refund terms.",
  },
  {
    h: "8. Stock Contractor Content",
    p: "Stock contractors control their own herd records, horse pages, and marketing content. Trip results and buck-off statistics attached to a horse are derived from submitted competition results and are not removable at request, because they are competition record. Ownership documentation stored in the app is stored for the contractor's convenience; storing it here does not satisfy any association filing requirement and does not make us responsible for a contractor's compliance.",
  },
  {
    h: "9. Marketplace",
    p: "Marketplace listings are created by users. We do not own, inspect, verify, or warrant any horse, animal, item, or service listed, including bucking stock, prospects, and breedings. Transactions are between buyer and seller. You are responsible for your own due diligence, including veterinary examination, soundness, health documentation, and transport arrangements. Report suspicious listings using the in-app reporting tools.",
  },
  {
    h: "10. Subscriptions and Billing",
    p: "Premium features are offered on monthly and annual subscriptions. Subscriptions renew automatically until cancelled. You may cancel at any time through your app store account or in the app; cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. Pricing may change with notice.",
  },
  {
    h: "11. Assumption of Risk",
    p: "Roughstock rodeo is among the most dangerous sports there is, and saddle bronc riding carries a real risk of serious injury or death. Nothing in this app reduces that risk. Training content, drills, and AI-generated coaching output are informational only and are not a substitute for qualified instruction, veterinary advice, or your own judgment. You participate in equine activities entirely at your own risk.",
  },
  {
    h: "12. Animal Welfare",
    p: "You agree to comply with the humane treatment rules of any association or rodeo you participate in, including flank strap, spur rowel, and equipment provisions. Content depicting abuse or mistreatment of animals is prohibited and will be removed, and may result in account termination and referral to the relevant sanctioning body.",
  },
  {
    h: "13. User Content and Conduct",
    p: "You retain ownership of content you post and grant us a license to host, display, and distribute it within the service. You agree not to post content that is unlawful, harassing, abusive, or that violates another person's privacy — and specifically not to use the service to contact minors outside of an established, guardian-visible school, barn, or mentor relationship. We may remove content and suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.",
  },
  {
    h: "14. Service Availability",
    p: "We provide the service on an as-is and as-available basis. We do not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation, and we may modify, suspend, or discontinue features at any time.",
  },
  {
    h: "15. Limitation of Liability",
    p: "To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apps 1, LLC is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, lost winnings, lost entry fees, or lost opportunities arising from your use of the service.",
  },
  {
    h: "16. Changes to These Terms",
    p: "We may update these terms as the product develops. Material changes will be communicated in the app and by email. Continued use after a change constitutes acceptance.",
  },
  {
    h: "17. Contact",
    p: "Questions about these terms can be sent to support@saddlebronc.pro.",
