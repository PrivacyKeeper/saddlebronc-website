            Ranch bronc is a different event with different rules entirely —
            working saddle, no mark-out, ride as ride can. That belongs to ranch
            rodeo, not here.
          </p>

          <h2>The draw is the event</h2>
          <p>
            In a judged event where half the score belongs to the animal, the
            draw is not administrative — it is competitive. Which makes{" "}
            <strong>draw integrity</strong> the single most sensitive thing in
            roughstock, and the easiest thing for a producer to be accused of
            getting wrong.
          </p>
          <p>So we make it auditable rather than asking anyone to take it on trust:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stock draw uses a documented random seed</li>
            <li>The seed and the timestamp are visible, not hidden</li>
            <li>The draw sheet is published and the record is locked</li>
            <li>Pen assignment comes from the contractor&apos;s herd, with rest tracking</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Once the draw is posted</h2>
          <p>
            Your horse and chute number are pushed to your phone, and the horse
            comes with its record: every recorded trip, buck-off rate, average
            horse score, buck pattern, and video where it exists. Plus your own
            history on that horse if you have been on it before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contractors know this information. Travel partners trade it verbally.
            It has simply never been written down anywhere a contestant can get
            at it.
          </p>

          <h2>Judging</h2>
          <p>
            Two judges enter four numbers — rider and horse, each out of 25 —
            and neither sees the other&apos;s entry before submitting. The total
            is computed from the four.
          </p>
          <p>
            Independent entry is worth building properly for two reasons. It is
            a credibility feature for producers, and it produces judge-split data
            that has real analytical value later: where two carded officials saw
            the same eight seconds differently.
          </p>

          <h2>Rerides</h2>
          <p>
            The console handles the whole flow — offer, accept or decline, and
            the reride draw. When a rider keeps an original score rather than
            taking a reride, that decision is recorded rather than lost.
          </p>

          <h2>For producers</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Stock draw with a documented seed and a locked audit record</li>
            <li>Pen assignment from a contractor&apos;s herd, with rest tracking</li>
            <li>Independent judge score entry, two judges, four numbers</li>
            <li>Reride management including the reride draw</li>
            <li>Equipment check log for the chute judge — rowels, saddle, rein</li>
            <li>Chute order and slack management</li>

          <h2>For stock contractors</h2>
          <p>
            Contractors are a first-class user here, not an afterthought — the
            data that makes this app valuable is theirs, and they should get
            real benefit back for it.
